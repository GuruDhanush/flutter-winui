Follow instructions from the [flutter desktop-embedding](https://github.com/google/flutter-desktop-embedding) to know more on how to build and run apps. Alternate platform implementation of flutter engine embed with go is also available [here](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter). Both implementations currently use [GLFW](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw) shell, so much changes are not expected in the toolkit implementation. Flutter embed might eventually migrate to an UWP implementation leading to better experience.
